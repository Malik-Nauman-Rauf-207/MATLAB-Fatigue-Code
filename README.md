## Introduction

Structural integrity assessment is crucial in aerospace engineering to ensure the safety and reliability of aircraft and spacecraft. This MATLAB application aims to simplify the process of assessing structural integrity by providing a user-friendly interface built with MATLAB App Designer. It implements Damage assessment and Structure failure criterias including Stress-Life, Strain-Life and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with MATLAB's App Designer, allowing users to interact with the tool effortlessly.
- **Structural Analysis**: Perform various structural analysis tasks such as stress analysis, fatigue analysis, and failure analysis
- **Customization**: Users can customize parameters and settings according to their specific requirements and input data.
- **Visualization**: Visualize analysis results through interactive plots and charts for better understanding and interpretation.
